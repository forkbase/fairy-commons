Making bash shell scripts more robust.

## Facilities ##

Programming a robust Bash script is usually non-trivial. Fortunately, you can refer to [`bash_bootstrap.sh`](lib/bash_bootstrap.sh) to bootstrap you Bash script in a right shape. Moreover, you may also leverage `bin/bootstrap_sh` to further ease the bootstrapping. (See the quick two-step setup [here](bin/README.md#setup))
